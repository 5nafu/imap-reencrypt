the gnupg lib does not allow to see for which keys a message was encrypted
beforehand. thus, create a new gpg home and import only the private key
of my yubi key, then point the library to that gnupghome. all messages for
other keys should just fail to decrypt.

split to multiple files for better overview

do not automatically use ReinsertableMessage .. if there was no change, we
do not want to reupload anything!
